================================

2DKS is a two-dimensional extension to the Kolmogorov-Smyrnov test for goodness-of-fit.
It is used to compare datasets of points to a distributions, or two datasets of points, and either rejects or not rejects the hypothesis that the sample was derived from the distribution, or that the two samples are derived from the same distribution.


Requirements: numpy, scipy.
